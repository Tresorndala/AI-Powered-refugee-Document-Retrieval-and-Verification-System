Overview

The AI-Powered Refugee Document Retrieval and Verification System is designed to address the critical issue of lost educational documents among refugees. Utilizing advanced AI and blockchain technology, the system offers a secure, efficient, and user-friendly solution for recovering and validating essential academic records. Initially focused on refugees from DR Congo and South Sudan in the Nakivale refugee settlement, the project aims to remove a significant barrier to education and support displaced individuals in reclaiming their academic credentials.

Motivation
Our analysis of refugee education challenges in Uganda reveals the severe impact of lost educational documents. Refugees fleeing conflict zones often struggle with missing records, exacerbating existing barriers and impeding academic progress. The following stories highlight the need for a robust solution to this issue:

Key Findings and Impact Stories
Tresor Ndala Buzangu's Journey: Tresor faced a critical challenge when he could not provide a passport required for a scholarship at Ashesi University after relocating to Nakivale refugee camp. This delay nearly cost him his place and scholarship, illustrating the systemic barriers refugees face due to lost or inaccessible documents.

John's Rejection Due to Missing Documents: John struggled with the absence of essential documents, including those related to his father's whereabouts and his own school records. His experience highlights the significant gaps in the system that prevent refugees from accessing educational opportunities.

Adelard's Experience with CIYOTA: Adelard benefited from CIYOTA's support in accessing a Mastercard scholarship at Ashesi University. However, he noted that many peers could not take advantage of similar opportunities due to missing documents, underscoring the need for comprehensive solutions to document loss.

Jeane's Challenges as a Female Refugee: Jeane's story reveals additional hurdles faced by female refugees. She highlighted concerns about menstrual health affecting school attendance and the challenges her peers face due to lost school documents from DR Congo. This underscores the need for targeted interventions addressing both educational and personal barriers.

Proposed Solution
To address these critical issues, the AI-Powered Document Retrieval and Verification System provides:

The AI-Powered Refugee Document Retrieval and Verification System uses several AI models, each playing a crucial role in solving the challenges faced by refugees due to lost educational documents. Here's the importance of each model:

NLP Model for Document Request Generation:

Importance: This model is fine-tuned to generate and translate formal document requests. It simplifies the process of requesting lost documents by automatically creating well-structured and culturally appropriate requests in multiple languages, ensuring accessibility for refugees from diverse linguistic backgrounds.



Predictive Model for Document Tracking:

Importance: This model is trained on historical request data and communication logs. It predicts the status and estimated retrieval time of document requests, providing refugees with real-time updates and transparency throughout the process. This feature helps manage expectations and reduces anxiety related to document recovery.


AI-Based Validation Model (CNN with OCR):

Importance: This model combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with optical character recognition (OCR) to validate the authenticity of retrieved documents. By cross-referencing with blockchain records, it ensures that the documents are legitimate, preventing fraud and providing a secure verification process crucial for educational and employment purposes.

Conversational AI Model for Chatbot Support:

Importance: The AI-powered chatbot, trained on FAQ data and historical support tickets, offers real-time assistance to users. It enhances user experience by providing instant support, guiding them through the document retrieval process, and addressing common issues, making the system more user-friendly and accessible.
Each model is integrated into the system to automate and streamline the process of document retrieval and verification, ensuring that refugees can reclaim their academic credentials and pursue educational and professional opportunities despite the challenges they face.




App Functionality

Homepage: Provides an introduction to the system and navigation options such as "Request Document," "Track Request," "Verify Document," and "Support."

Request Document Page: Allows users to input personal information and document details, submit requests, and receive automated, translated requests.

Track Request Page: Enables users to track the status of their document requests with real-time updates and estimated completion times.

Verify Document Page: Users can upload documents for verification, which are processed and validated using AI and blockchain technology.

Support Page: Features an AI-powered chatbot and a contact form for additional assistance, providing real-time support and guidance.

Next Steps

The initial focus will be on refugees from DR Congo and South Sudan in Nakivale, with plans to expand to additional regions and populations. The project aims to effectively address the issue of lost documents and support refugees in accessing academic and professional opportunities despite their challenges.
